# Arduino-Sine-Wave-LED
Use a PWM Pin on an Arduino to light a LED using rising and falling motion similar to a sine wave, rather than using a harser trianglar wave.

Line 27 of SineLED.ino controls the frequency of the oscillation. Simply change the "2000.0" figure to higher or lower figure to increase or decrease the time oscillation respectively.
